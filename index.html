    <h2><em><bold>It's NICE to be nice</bold></em></h2>
    <p class=" para1">“Be nice.” It’s simple, obvious advice, most memorably articulated by Patrick Swayze in Road House. In our everchanching world things are really tough, yes, we have to be sharp and wise more, but being nice goes  a long way.   </p>

    <h2><bold><em>Pay Forward</em></bold></h2>
    <p class=" para2">The one who plants the tree is not the one who will enjoy its shade. ~ Chinese Proverbs.
        You could calculate, if I will not harvest the fruits myself, l don't bother. But wise one will step ahead and calculate this: my grandchildren might use and benefit from those trees, their friends and loved ones - REMEMBER: we all connected. Trees talks to each other and connected by their roots, so are we, humans.</p>

    <h2><bold><em>Kindness Pays Off</em></bold></h2>
    <p class=" para3">Kindness might not seem like the best thing to do, but I assure you that you would in the end never regret being nice and kind to people. You might not see the exact outcome of what you are doing, but when you think about it, you would realize that it is important that we be nice and kind. And when we talk about being nice and kind, people think of other people.<br>If a dead tree falls, it carries with it a live one. ~ Kenyan Proverb <span style='font-size:40px;'>&#127795;</span>
